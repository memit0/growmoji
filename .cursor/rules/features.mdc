# Feature Implementation Guidelines

The main selling point of the app is it's design! I want a v0 shadcn clean minimilistic design style! 

## Todo List
- Implement CRUD operations with local and remote state
- Add filtering and sorting capabilities
- Include due dates and priority levels
- Support task categories or tags

## Habit Tracker
- Track habit completion with streak counting
- Provide calendar view for historical data
- Support different frequency types (daily, weekly, etc.)
- Include progress visualizations

## Pomodoro Timer
- Implement configurable work/break intervals
- Add sound notifications for interval changes
- Provide session history and statistics
- Allow linking timer sessions to specific tasks

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Ensure data syncs across platforms
- Implement offline capabilities
- Maintain consistent UI patterns across features
- Use proper navigation between features
